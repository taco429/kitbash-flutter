# Game Over Screen Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive game over screen that displays when a player wins the game. The implementation includes winner detection, a visually appealing victory screen, and navigation options.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Game Over Screen (`lib/screens/game_over_screen.dart`)
- **Visual Design**: Beautiful gradient background with animated victory elements
- **Winner Display**: Shows the winner's player index and name with appropriate colors
- **Trophy Animation**: Displays a trophy icon with glowing effects in the winner's color
- **Action Buttons**: Three navigation options:
  - **Play Again**: Creates a new CPU game
  - **Find New Game**: Navigate to game lobby
  - **Main Menu**: Return to the main menu

### 2. Winner Detection Logic (`lib/services/game_service.dart`)
- **GameState Enhancement**: Added `winnerPlayerIndex` field and winner detection methods
- **Automatic Detection**: `computedWinner` getter determines winner by checking which players have alive command centers
- **Game Over Check**: `isGameOver` property checks if game status is 'finished' or winner is determined
- **Winner Names**: `getWinnerName()` method provides display names for players

### 3. Game Screen Integration (`lib/screens/game_screen.dart`)
- **Automatic Navigation**: Detects when game is over and automatically navigates to game over screen
- **State Management**: Converted to StatefulWidget to handle navigation state
- **Prevention Logic**: Prevents multiple navigations with `_hasNavigatedToGameOver` flag

## How It Works

1. **During Gameplay**: The game tracks command center health through the existing damage system
2. **Winner Detection**: When a command center is destroyed, the system checks if only one player has remaining alive command centers
3. **Automatic Transition**: The GameScreen continuously monitors the game state and automatically navigates to the GameOverScreen when a winner is determined
4. **Victory Display**: The GameOverScreen shows the winner with appropriate colors (green for Player 1, pink for Player 2)

## Testing the Feature

To test the game over functionality:

1. **Start a Game**: Use "Play vs CPU" or create a multiplayer game
2. **Deal Damage**: Use the test buttons in the game screen:
   - Green button: Damage Player 1 (Green)
   - Pink button: Damage Player 2 (Pink)
3. **Destroy Command Center**: Keep dealing damage until one player's command center reaches 0 health
4. **Observe Transition**: The game will automatically navigate to the game over screen
5. **Test Navigation**: Try the different navigation options on the game over screen

## Player Colors
- **Player 1**: Green (`Colors.green`)
- **Player 2**: Pink (`Colors.pink`)

## Code Quality Fixes

Fixed all Flutter analyzer issues:
- ✅ Added `const` constructors where appropriate (`prefer_const_constructors`)
- ✅ Used `const` literals for immutable class arguments (`prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables`)  
- ✅ Replaced deprecated `withOpacity()` with `withValues(alpha:)` (`deprecated_member_use`)
- ✅ Added proper context checking for async operations (`use_build_context_synchronously`)
- ✅ Used explicit generic types `<Widget>[]` for better type safety

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Animated victory effects
- Sound effects for victory
- Statistics display (game duration, turns played, etc.)
- Replay functionality
- Tournament mode support
- Custom player names instead of "Player 1/2"
