 This file outlines the requirements and restrictions of decks.

 A deck has a Hero. 
 - Respawning Hero unit, this is basically a unit card that is always available to play, unless it is already in play or died (2 turn respawn?)
 - A signature Hero card, this is a unique card that is added to the deck that is only availble when playing with this hero
 - 10 pawns, these are basic units of the color to fill out the deck and make sure there's enough low power cards in every deck
 A deck also includes 20 cards of the players choice from the hero's color identity.
