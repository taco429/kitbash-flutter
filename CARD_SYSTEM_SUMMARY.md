# Card Collection & Deck System Implementation

This document summarizes the card collection and deck system that has been implemented for the Kitbash CCG Flutter game.

## Overview

We've successfully created a comprehensive card system with:
- **2 Creature Cards**: Skeleton Warrior (purple) and Goblin Raider (red)
- **2 Enhanced Variants**: Skeleton Archer and Goblin Chieftain
- **2 Pre-built Decks**: Red Goblin Swarm and Purple Undead Legion
- **Complete UI**: Card display widgets and collection viewer

## Card System Architecture

### Core Models

1. **GameCard** (`lib/models/card.dart`)
   - Represents individual cards with properties like cost, attack, health, abilities
   - Supports different card types (Creature, Spell, Artifact)
   - Includes card colors/factions (Red, Purple, Blue, Green, White, Black, Neutral)
   - JSON serialization for data persistence

2. **DeckCard** (`lib/models/card.dart`)
   - Represents card instances in decks with quantity
   - Links GameCard with deck-specific data

3. **Deck** (`lib/models/deck.dart`)
   - Updated to contain actual DeckCard instances
   - Automatically calculates total card count
   - Maintains deck metadata (name, color, description)

### Card Implementations

#### Skeleton Cards (Purple)
- **Skeleton Warrior**: Cost 2, 2/1 creature with Undead ability
- **Skeleton Archer**: Cost 3, 2/2 creature with Undead and Ranged abilities

#### Goblin Cards (Red)
- **Goblin Raider**: Cost 1, 2/1 creature with Haste ability
- **Goblin Chieftain**: Cost 3, 3/2 creature with Haste and Rally abilities

### Services

1. **CardService** (`lib/services/card_service.dart`)
   - Manages the complete card database
   - Provides search and filtering capabilities
   - Offers collection statistics
   - Supports querying by color, type, cost, abilities

2. **DeckService** (`lib/services/deck_service.dart`)
   - Updated to create actual decks with cards
   - Pre-built Red Goblin deck (30 cards: 23 Goblin Raiders + 7 Goblin Chieftains)
   - Pre-built Purple Skeleton deck (30 cards: 15 Skeleton Warriors + 15 Skeleton Archers)
   - Deck selection and management functionality

## User Interface

### CardWidget (`lib/widgets/card_widget.dart`)
- Visual representation of game cards
- Supports both full and compact display modes
- Color-coded by card faction
- Shows all card stats (cost, attack, health, abilities)
- Interactive with tap handling

### CollectionScreen (`lib/screens/collection_screen.dart`)
- Three-tab interface:
  1. **All Cards**: Grid view of entire collection with statistics
  2. **Red Deck**: Detailed view of the Goblin Swarm deck
  3. **Purple Deck**: Detailed view of the Undead Legion deck
- Card detail dialogs with full information
- Deck composition analysis

### Menu Integration
- Added "View Collection" button to main menu
- Seamless navigation to collection screen

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suites included:
- **Card Model Tests** (`test/models/card_test.dart`)
  - Card property validation
  - JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Power level calculations
  - Collection filtering

- **Deck Service Tests** (`test/services/deck_service_test.dart`)
  - Deck initialization
  - Card composition validation
  - Deck selection functionality
  - Error handling for invalid deck IDs

## Deck Compositions

### Red Goblin Swarm Deck (30 cards)
- 23x Goblin Raider (1 cost, 2/1, Haste)
- 7x Goblin Chieftain (3 cost, 3/2, Haste + Rally)
- **Strategy**: Aggressive, low-cost creatures for quick attacks

### Purple Undead Legion Deck (30 cards)
- 15x Skeleton Warrior (2 cost, 2/1, Undead)
- 15x Skeleton Archer (3 cost, 2/2, Undead + Ranged)
- **Strategy**: Balanced mix of melee and ranged undead units

## Integration Points

The card system is fully integrated with:
- **Provider State Management**: CardService and updated DeckService
- **Main App**: Services registered in main.dart
- **Navigation**: Accessible from main menu
- **Game Logic**: Ready for integration with game mechanics

## Future Expansion

The system is designed for easy expansion:
- Add new card types (Spells, Artifacts)
- Implement more factions/colors
- Create deck building functionality
- Add card rarity system
- Implement card effects and abilities system
